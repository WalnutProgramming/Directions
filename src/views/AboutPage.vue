    <h1 class="title">Walnut.Direct</h1>
    <p class="squished-p">
      Walnut Hills High School is a big and confusing school to navigate,
      especially for incoming students. That's why we created Walnut.Direct,
      straightforward directions between rooms in Walnut Hills.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subtitle">How to Use It</h1>
    <p class="squished-p">
      On the <router-link to="/">main page</router-link>, type (or choose from
      the dropdown) the name of the classroom you're starting at or a nearby
      classroom. Then, type or select the classroom you're going to. Press Go.
    </p>
    <p class="squished-p">
      You can use the My Schedule page to input your bell schedule so that you
      don't have to remember and re-type the room numbers.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subtitle">The Project:</h1>
    <p class="squished-p">
      Our goal is that any new student can
      <router-link to="/myschedule">type in their schedule</router-link> and use
      our app to get to any classroom in the school. We want the directions to
      be as clear as possible, since the first day at a new school can be
      stressful enough as it is.
    </p>
    <p class="squished-p">
      We've also made sure to make our work as generalizable as possible so that
      it can be extended to work in other buildings, such as hospitals. For this
      reason, we've published our
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/room-finder">
        room-finder package
      </a>
      on npm so that anyone can use it for another building.
    </p>
    <h1 class="subtitle">Our Club:</h1>
    <p class="squished-p">
      The Walnut Hills Programming Club, a chapter of
      <a href="https://interalliance.org/">INTERalliance</a>, meets every
      Thursday in room 3104 to learn about programming and to work on projects
      that we will present at competitions. The club is open to everyone
      interested in computers and IT. Club members can participate in
      <a href="https://techolympics.org/">TechOlympics</a>, a weekend convention
      for high school students interested in IT, go to summer workshops, and get
      paid internships in local companyâ€™s IT departments. If you're interested
      in working on projects like this one, you should come, regardless of how
      much or little programming experience you have!

      You can go to the

        Feedback
      </router-link>
      section to tell us how we can improve the project. The project is NOT
      finished, and we are aware of a lot of issues, including the fact that
      we're missing the 1400s, 2400s, cafeteria, some rooms in the gym, and some
      rooms in the science wing. However, if you notice any problems, we would
      really appreciate it if you report them in the Feedback form.
