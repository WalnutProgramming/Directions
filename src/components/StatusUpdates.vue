        The Walnut Hills Programming Club is currently in the process of
        modifying this app's directions based on the COVID-19 precautions for
        one-way stairways. We are also working on adding a few missing rooms â€”
        most importantly, the cafeteria. Many of the routes given by the app
        will change once we make these changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walnut.Direct does not currently include outdoor routes, but if you know
        how to get to a room by going outdoors, we recommend that.
