        Be sure to stay distanced, walk on the right side of the hallway, and
        follow all rules given by the administration for COVID-19 safety.
        Walnut.Direct takes the new one-way staircases into account when
        providing directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walnut.Direct does not currently include outdoor routes, but if you know
        how to get to a room by going outdoors, we recommend that.
