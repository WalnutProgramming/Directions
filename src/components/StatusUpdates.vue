        Be sure to stay distanced, walk on the right side of the hallway, and
        follow all rules given by the administration for COVID-19 safety.

        The Walnut Hills Programming Club is currently in the process of
        modifying this app's directions based on the COVID-19 precautions for
        one-way stairways. We are also working on adding a few missing rooms â€”
        most importantly, the cafeteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walnut.Direct does not currently include outdoor routes, but if you know
        how to get to a room by going outdoors, we recommend that.
